## <a name="ingredients"></a>:computer: Ingredients


what you need for this setup is really simple 

* Up and running Linux VPS outside your country 
* A domain name

------

## <a name="cdn"></a>:rocket: Config CDN
#### 1. for CDN configuration you need to create an account in any free CDN website like Cloudflare AWS or any other CDN you like ( for Iranian [ArvanCloud](https://www.arvancloud.ir/en/products/cdn) or [Derak](https://derak.cloud/) also works very well and is recommended.)
for this tutorial, we will use Cloudflare.

* Create an account in Cloudflare. this step is really simple.
go to your dashboard.

![dashboard](img/1.jpg)

* click on `Add a site` and enter your domain name.

![Alt text](img/2.jpg)

* On the next page select the free plan

![Alt text](img/3.jpg)

* On the next page, you should config your DNS Record.
1. click on `Add Record`
2. Type: A
3. Name: @
4. Ip Address: Add your VPS IP address here
5. Proxy: **MAKE SURE PROXY IS ON** this is very important if you don't turn on this option your IP will be visible.
6. You can add a CNAME Or another A record for www.


![Alt text](img/4.jpg)

* Cloudflare will give you 2 Nameservers that you need to update in your domain panel.

![Alt text](img/5.jpg)

After Updating your DNS settings go to your SSL/TLS Menu and Select overview.

* put SSL/TLS encryption mode on Full (strict)
* Turn on SSL/TLS Recommender

![Alt text](img/6.jpg)

That's it. we are done with Cloudflare. :)

## <a name="domain"></a>:satellite: Config your Domain
this is a simple step and it depends on how you got your domain.
you should update your domain's Name server in your domain panel with your CDN Name servers. Make sure they get updated and working fine. then continue to the next steps.

you can use any DnsLookup tools like [mxtoolbox.com](https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx) This site should find your A record like the below image. It can take some time. it can take some time.

## <a name="nginx"></a>:lock: Install Nginx
we need a webserver for our website and an SSL certificate.

**CentOS** :

Install the EPEL repository:
```console
sudo yum install epel-release
```

Update the repository and Install NGINX:
```console
sudo yum update
sudo yum install nginx
```
**Debina/ubuntu** :

Update the repository and Install NGINX:
```console
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
```
you should be done. now we need a website.

## <a name="website"></a>:ghost: Nginx With Fake Website 
This is where things get tricky but don't worry it is quite easy.

**NOTE:replace ALL `your_domain` with your actual domain.**

Create the directory for `your_domain` as follows, using the -p flag to create any necessary parent directories:

```console
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/your_domain/html
```
Next, assign ownership of the directory with the $USER environment variable:

```console
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/your_domain/html
```

Next, create a sample index.html page using nano or your favorite editor:

```console
sudo nano /var/www/your_domain/html/index.html
```
Inside, add the following sample HTML or anything you like:
```HTML
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Welcome to your_domain!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Success!  The your_domain server block is working!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```
Save and close the file by pressing Ctrl+X to exit, then when prompted to save, Y and then Enter.

I prefer to use a real website template and modify it to look like a real website. but it is your choice.

In order for Nginx to serve this content, it’s necessary to create a server block with the correct directives.


```console
sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

change your config like the code below but updated for our new directory and domain name:

```console
user nginx;
worker_processes auto;
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
pid /run/nginx.pid;

include /usr/share/nginx/modules/*.conf;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;

    sendfile            on;
    tcp_nopush          on;
    tcp_nodelay         on;
    keepalive_timeout   65;
    types_hash_max_size 4096;

    include             /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type        application/octet-stream;

    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;

    server {
        server_name  sample.com www.sample.com;
        root         /var/www/html; #/usr/share/nginx/html;

        # Load configuration files for the default server block.
        include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

        error_page 404 /404.html;
        location = /404.html {
        }

        error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
        }

        location /Replace_with_YOUR_RANDOM_STRING {
                proxy_redirect off;
                proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:11111; # REPLACE WITH YOUR VMESS/VLESS port
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
                proxy_set_header Host $http_host;



        }
}

```

**MAKE SURE ALL `your_domain` HAS BEEN CHANGED WITH YOUR ACTUAL DOMAIN. server_name is your domain section**


Save and close the file when you are finished.
Next, test to make sure that there are no syntax errors in any of your Nginx files:

```console
sudo nginx -t
```

If there aren’t any problems, restart Nginx to enable your changes:

```console
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## <a name="certificate"></a>:lock: Get SSL Certificate
you need a valid SSL certificate for your website. make sure your firewall allows communication on ports 80 and 443.


we will use certbot and Let's Encrypt for our free SSL certificate.

The first step to using Let’s Encrypt to obtain an SSL certificate is to install the Certbot software on your server.

Install Certbot and its Nginx plugin with apt:

```console
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Certbot provides a variety of ways to obtain SSL certificates through plugins. The Nginx plugin will take care of reconfiguring Nginx and reloading the config whenever necessary. To use this plugin, type the following:

```console
sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain -d www.your_domain
```
This runs certbot with the --nginx plugin, using -d to specify the domain names we’d like the certificate to be valid for.

if certbot asked you the following question select number 2.

```console
Please choose whether or not to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, removing HTTP access.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration.
2: Redirect - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. Choose this for
new sites, or if you're confident your site works on HTTPS. You can undo this
change by editing your web server's configuration.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel):

```

if certbot has been able to get your certificate you should see the following message

```console
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2020-08-18. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
   with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
   your certificates, run "certbot renew"
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
```

your certificates are in the following directories you need them. so keep them safe and remember the path.

```console
/etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain/fullchain.pem

/etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain/privkey.pem
```

we are almost there. 

## <a name="v2ray"></a>:mahjong: Setup V2Ray 
Now it is getting exciting.
connect to your VPS via SSH. 
Get your server up to date:

ubuntu:

``` console
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
````

RedHat centOS:

``` console
sudo yum update && sudo yum upgrade 
````

Download V2ray (x-UI panel) and install it.

``` console
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaxilu/x-ui/master/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
Waiting for installation. unfortunately, this script is in Chinese and all English versions are outdated. so bear with me.
after you saw `complete` enter y 

![Alt text](img/8.jpg)

then enter your username for the x-ui login
![Alt text](img/9.jpg)

and then your password for X-ui panel (don't use this password set any strong password of at least 12 characters including symbols numbers capital letters :D )

![Alt text](img/10.jpg)

now you need to set your panel port. the default port is 54321. you can keep that and press enter.
![Alt text](img/11.jpg)

you should see a menu like this:
![Alt text](img/12.jpg)

that means your X-ui installation is complete. you can check your x-ui service with `sudo x-ui status` command and start it with `sudo x-ui start`.

Now go to http://yourdomain.xyz:54321 you should see the x-ui login panel.

![Alt text](img/13.jpg)

log in with your username and password that you have set during installation. you should see a dashboard like this.

![Alt text](img/14.jpg)

use google chrome or Microsoft edge to translate it into english.

in inbound menu click on + icon

![Alt text](img/15.jpg)

* select Vmess
* set extra ID to 64
* set transmition on `ws`
* set path to a random string at least 8 character
* leave everything else as default.

![Alt text](img/16.jpg)

<a name="GUID">just make sure to save the ID somewhere.</a>

and that's done.

## <a name="nginx-v2ray"></a>:bulb: Config Nginx for your V2ray
you made it. this is the golden part.

we will change the nginx config to redirect our calls to the ws path to Vmess this way so every normal request will load our website unless we call the magic ws path.

open your nginx config file.

```console
sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
add a location like this in your nginx file.

```console

        location /djfgGw84$ {
                proxy_redirect off;
                proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:32426;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
                proxy_set_header Host $http_host;

        }
```
in the above file replace `djfgGw84` with your eandom path from vmess-ws part. and in http://0.0.0.0:32426 replace 32426 with your vmess port.

reload your nginx service.

```console
 sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
and you are done. congratulations.

## <a name="client"></a>:computer: Config client
for windos client you can use [v2rayN](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN) 

this is the link for their latest release

`https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN/releases/download/6.10/v2rayN-With-Core.zip`

when you have download it add a vmess server and fill the info like the image

![Alt text](img/18.jpg)

* replace `your_domain` with your actual domain
* replace UUID with the ID in the this [section](#GUID)

* **your port should be 443**
* Alter ID : 64
* Transport: Ws
* Path: to your Random ws path
* set tls

and your Client is done.

you can use same config on your Android or IOS 

for android you can use [ShadowRocket](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.v2cross.shadowrocket&hl=en&gl=US) and for IOS you can use [Shadowlink](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shadowlink-shadowsocks-vpn/id1439686518) 

## <a name="bbr"></a>:bulb: Enable BBR
This part is optional but it has a big impact on your speed especially if you have too many users.

you can use this [link](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-enable-tcp-bbr-to-improve-network-speed-on-linux/) for BBR configuration.
